# 🛡️ Phishing URL Detector Pro

## Overview
**Phishing URL Detector Pro** is a multi-page Streamlit dashboard that leverages machine learning to detect phishing websites based on structural, lexical, WHOIS, and HTML/JS features. This tool empowers users to explore how phishing detection works—from data analysis and model training to real-time predictions.

> **Why it matters:** Phishing attacks are one of the most prevalent cyber threats. Automating URL classification using ML helps reduce risk at scale and enhances proactive defense mechanisms.

## 🔄 What’s New
- ✅ **Refactored to a multi-page Streamlit app** for better modularity and UX.
- 📈 **Achieves >99% accuracy** with XGBoost and Random Forest.
- ⚙️ Optimized WHOIS domain age feature with fallbacks.
- 📊 Enhanced EDA and feature visualization.
- 🔍 Real-time URL detector with improved feature extraction.

---

## ⚙️ Features & Capabilities
- 🔬 Live phishing URL prediction using trained ML models.
- 📊 Dataset exploration and visual summaries.
- 📈 Feature correlation and distribution visualizations.

## 💾 Model Saving & Loading
```python
# Save trained models
to_save = {'XGBoost': xgb_model, 'Random Forest': rf_model}
with open('trained_models.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(to_save, f)

# Load models in app
with open('trained_models.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    models = pickle.load(f)
```
